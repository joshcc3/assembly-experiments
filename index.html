Prefer to set all values that use only part of a register, esp. ones where you use only a part of the register to a known (0?) value
Check all arguments before making a function call - e.g. for futex - you *must* zero out the timestruct
When constructing a large program, never keep things in your head, jot them down as todos as soon as they occur to you
Make sure that all functions return
Make sure to always pop off everything that you pushii

Remember to set the return value in rax fo

Never refer to registers by their names unless its for initialization - always use macros or the stack

Pay close attention to the size of the operands and registers used

Prefer using the callee's registers unless you don't make any calls in the function
Prefer the stack over raw registers because you have to either save them between calls or restore them at the end depending on which set you use

Always provide signature types in definitions.
Always state your invariants and provide asserts

Perform error checking on operations

Sometimes arguments need to be page aligned - futex
Always perform error handling after every operation
